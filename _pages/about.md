# About us

The Pan-Asia Youth Collaborative Academic Team on Lifetime and Reliability (PYCAT-LR) is committed to establishing an international academic ecosystem for emerging scholars. Guided by our motto "Agile Minds Leading Revolution", we foster cutting-edge collaborative innovation in system lifespan prediction and reliability engineering among Asia's new generation researchers. Through cross-border multidisciplinary dialogues, we build open knowledge networks to cultivate globally-minded young academic leaders, collectively addressing fundamental challenges in complex system lifecycle management. Focusing on the developmental needs of scholars under 40, we create comprehensive collaboration frameworks encompassing theoretical breakthroughs, technological innovations, and engineering applications, injecting sustained vitality into reliability science advancement.

This is the energy roadmap for Japan at 2060, where over 80% were clean energy for power generation. Main features of clean energy generation techniques are to improve energy efficiency and enhance energy use space, which would result in the interaction of multiple damage modes for structural materials such as creep-fatigue. In response, accurate life assessment technique is one of the necessary measures to ensure long-life and high-reliability operations of critical components.

The significance is to provide the theoretical and scientific basis for the safe operations of these critical components. It is manifested from the following two aspects. Currently, it can avoid unexpected failure of in-service equipment. Future, it also promote the development of next-generation equipment.

We have made preliminary attempts on active life design and achieved good results. The object is the hold structures strengthening, both qualitative and quantitative assessment provides potential active design treatments. This attempt proves the feasibility and executability of the proposed research idea.
